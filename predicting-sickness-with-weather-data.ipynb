    "Before we evan start discussing missing values imputation, we need to define the scope of a definition missing values. Is it just NaN, can it be 0 or 999 or some other value? For that we ought to plot the variables and check our usual suspects. Other tactic would also be to ask meterologist. It can happen that for example humidity readings machine gives 999 when in defect. Let us assume we are only dealing with NaN.\n",

    "weather.fillna(method='bfill') Foreward, backward filling. It is reasonable. Data point in previous or next step should also be the one missing. It is robust in the sense that we do not have to make any assumptions about the data. Imputation works best when many variables are missing in small proportions. The power boost is much less impressive when one important variable is missing in 70% of cases, because the uncertainty in estimates will yield highly varying imputed datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "weather = weather.fillna(weather.mean()) Mean is prone to outliers, and imputation would fail. It also reduces the variance in the data. We could opt for median to avoid outliers. Assumptions for pad and bfill also hold for this imputation\n",

Papers show that this ought to be the best solution for MAR-data. We are going to use neat package called fancyimpute. There we could have used kNN (Which also very reasonable) to imputata. Please note that it works only on numpy array, so we need to convert back and fort!\n"

Let us check for data_weather[data_weather['temp_7h'].isnull()] there are some missing values and they seem to be rather randomly scattered. Taking that into account we are going to use simple backwardfill here. Analog for 'temp_14h' and 'temp_19h'.\n",

    "'wind_degrees' is the interesting one. There a couple of missing values in the beginning but in the last year we observe that data is missing for whole months at a part. Logically we ought to do simple interpolate() for the few values that are missing in the beginning and than just copy the months from previous year (2017) or any other year for that matter. We only need to find the row indices of the previous year months and than replace it with the missing values in 2018. Finally 'skyCover_14h','skyCover_19h','skyCover_7h','sun_hours' are all missing values at the same time (just a few of them) once again I opt for simple interpolate().\n",

But after consulting online it seems that Multiple imputation with MICE is the best option, that is why I wanted to use that. Unfortunately I did not manage to install the library fancyimputer, so I opted for polynomial interpolation (\"piecewise_poly\") there I hope that polynomial function will catch trends and predict/imputate missing values.\n",

    "There is no precise way to define and identify outliers in general because of the specifics of each dataset. Instead, you, or a domain expert, must interpret the raw observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not. Nevertheless, we can use statistical methods to identify observations that appear to be rare or unlikely given the available data. We will assume that outliers are only to be found in temperature measuraments. From the plots above we can see there are some points that fall far out of the normal one or two points standard deviation. With three we should be certain that it is an outlier and that is why we should remove it. Alternatively we can also say that standard deviation is heavily influenced with the outliers. To remedy that I also implemented a an IQR (inter quartile range) method that removes all values that fall below or above IQR (which is Q1-Q3). With these two relatively simple methods we should be able to recognize most of the outliers. Qualitative examination would also be beneficial (and they were since we had couple of very hot days in winter ;)), along with other more advanced techniques.\n",

    "For the missing values I just interpolated the missing values (standard imputation technique). But inspecting the data I see that there some values that are 40 degrees in winter (in temp_14columns). So we also need to make sure that these are also gone, since they are definitely an outlier. So I located these valus and set them to NaN then i interpolated all of the NaN with polynomial interpolation.\n",

    " Let us first talk what we did additionally with the data (pre-processing, assumptions etc...) than the models: Label encoding, important but than I realised that they are already label encoded (not hot-one!) I would like to stay with this assumption since week category obviously matters but also years will be different from each other(global warming etc.) Than I normalized all of the columns. Than I extracted the 2018 data which is our test data(y_2018,X_2018). And with help of train_test from sklearn I created training and validation sets (X_train,X_test)\n",

    "First model---NN. Started of with manually checking the hyperparameters-of course very bad tactic but atleast I got a feeling of the hyperparameters. Then I implemented a grid search for neural network. Time expensive! I commented the code out because it takes way to long. Results? Training set (in-sample error: 0.17964286018957273  Validation set:0.18736383060332323  Test set (out-of sample error): 0.27193468030735335\n",

Now that is already better and 80/20 : 0.21209512149397639 0.22662413117187602 0.3066506555408157. I have to be honest I was suprised, but it just goes to show case the difference in using different splits when training. NN had more data to learn on (with 80/20, but 70/30 was not efficient), hence it had better results. NOTE: For neural networks is seems to be impossible to achieve absolute reproducibility. I understand that randomness comes from 2 sources. First of all when I use cross validation train_test_split function but there I defined random_state=42. Another source is the initialisation of the weights. Every time it is going to be different. I tried to tackle that on 2 ways: \n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Findings:**</span> There is not much to say here other than we confirmed quantitively what was already familiar, namely there is more flu in winter time, temperature, humidity and other factors influence/are connected in certain ways to the outcome of the epidemy. Certain values fall in the range of normal/expected values of every variable, everything beyond that is simply outlier. I would say that finding fall in scope of normal reasoning.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**Lessons:**</span>I think the reader of this assignment can learn more about neural network hyper-parameter hardship. Trial and error wont work and we need to have more quantitative approach, like randomized-search. Grid search is out of the question until we get quant computers (run-time is awfull). Problems with reproducibility of NN, making the same initial weights for the artificial neural network is pretty hard. How can we implement randomized search for random forests. Different imputation techniques and also to think qualitatively and inspect the data, not only blindly apply the techniques(thats how I found out that some of the outliers in winter were deliberately set to 40, have I only applied those two techniques with standard deviation or inter-quartile range, I would have missed it!). Furthermore what are some interesting aggregation measures that we can introduce to our dataset(feature engineering, we can potentially get a better prediction if we make the features ourselves). How to compactly visualize the dataset in 3 plots, cross-validation with model_selection from sklearn and datetime library together with isocalendar function... There were a lot of interesting lessons learned, these are just a few that stuck for sure.\n",
